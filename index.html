    <h2>Hello world and ground control to Major Tom</h2>

        Jan 29th 2025. I made this site around the time I first started to code.
        I consider myself lucky to start when I did, as I was able to get pretty good by the time AI rolled around.
        I found this site looking through my old github projects and was reminded of that feeling when I first accessed the site through my web browser.
        It's fun learning this kind of stuff.
